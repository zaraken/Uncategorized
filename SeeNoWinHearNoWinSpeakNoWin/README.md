AHK script.

Use Win+Mousewheel to make any (the active) window AlwaysOnTop & ClickThrough & Transparent (at the same time)
Win+O to reset to normal.

If you lose the handle (because the script was restarted for example) you would have to manually activate
a clickthrough window (with Alt+Tab for example) to be able to use the script on it.
